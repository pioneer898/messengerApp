# Messenger App

## Overview
Simple messaging app with chatrooms. This project was created as part of an interview process, where the assignment was to create a simple chat messaging app in a 6-7 hour timeframe. I built this project from scratch in that timeframe then implemented new features during a live coding interview. This project highlights my ability to create a solid minimum viable product that is architected with forethought and future developments in mind.
